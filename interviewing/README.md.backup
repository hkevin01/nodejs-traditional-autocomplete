## 📋 Usage Scenarios

### 🎤 Live Coding Interview
```bash
# Interviewer requests: "Show me async/await patterns"
# Navigate to: nodejs_fundamentals.ipynb → Section 2
# Execute cells demonstrating sequential vs concurrent execution
# Real-time output shows performance differences
```

### 🧪 Technical Deep Dive
```bash
# Interviewer: "How would you optimize React performance?"
# Open: react_components.ipynb → Section 3
# Demonstrate React.memo, useMemo, virtual lists
# Show before/after performance metrics
```

### 🔍 Code Review Simulation
```bash
# Interviewer: "Walk me through error handling strategies"
# Navigate to error handling sections in both notebooks
# Show custom error classes, retry patterns, error boundaries
# Explain architectural decisions
```
